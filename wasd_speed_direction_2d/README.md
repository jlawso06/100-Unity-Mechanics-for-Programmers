# WASD Speed and Direction (2D)  

## Description
This mechenic shows how to implement control over speed and direction in 2D for a user's character using a set of input keys. For example, if a user was controlling a car or other vehicle. The code below shows how to use the W and S keys to speed up and slow down, respectively, while the A and D keys turn/rotate the character left and right, respectively. The code can be modified to use any set of keys such as IJKL or arrow keys.
